# STABLE DIFFUSION EXPERIMENT CONFIGURATION
# This config file contains the experiment configuration for the Stable Diffusion inpaint model from the diffusers library.


# IDENTIFIER CONFIGURATIONS
# Specifies the model and experiment identifiers.
# DO NOT CHANGE THESE!
model_identifier: inpaint
exp_identifier: interpolation


# MODEL CONFIGURATIONS
# Specifies the model configurations.
model_id: ./weights/stable-diffusion-2-inpainting  # Name of the Stable Diffusion repository on HuggingFace (e.g. stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1) or the path to the cloned repository (e.g. /mypath/stable-diffusion-2-1).
scheduler: DPMSolverMultistepScheduler  # Name of the scheduler algorithm.
att_slicing: True  # Whether attention slicing should be used (reduces memory consumption during the diffusion process at the cost of speed).
vae_slicing: True  # Whether VAE slicing should be used (reduces memory consumption during the decoding stage at the cost of speed).
vae_tiling: False  # Whether VAE tiling should be used (reduces memory consumption during the decoding stage at the cost of speed).
enable_xformers: False  # Whether to enable xFormers for optimized performance in the attention blocks (requires the xformers package).
gpu_id: 0  # GPU index.
diffusion_steps: 25  # Amount of diffusion steps to perform (higher values increase quality at the cost of speed).
guidance_scale: 9.5  # Guidance scale factor for classifier free guidance (higher values lead to better correspondence to the prompt, while lower values increase diversity).


# EXPERIMENT CONFIGURATIONS
# Specifies the experiment configurations.
output_path: ./experiments  # Path for storing the experiment results (a new folder will be placed at the specified location).
gif_frame_dur: 100  # Specifies the frame duration in milliseconds for the produced gifs.
interpolation_steps: 30  # Specifies the amount of interpolation steps to perform.
interpolation_method: slerp  # Specifies the interpolation method (can be either "lerp" for linear interpolation or "slerp" for spherical linear interpolation).
inter_prompts:  # List of prompts to interpolate. List items can be simple prompts or paths to local files containing the prompt embeddings.
  - A cowboay|low resolution, blurry, black and white
  - A humnaoid roboter|low resolution, blurry, black and white
  - A police officer|low resolution, blurry, black and white
inter_noises:  # List of latent noise tensors to interpolate. List items can be random seeds for sampling new latent noise (uses the "height" and "width" parameters) or paths to local files containing the latent noise tensors.
  - 0

# IMAGE & MASK CONFIGURATION
rand_seed: 0  # Random seed for sampling the encoded latents of the input image from the VAE.
height: 768  # Image height of the desired VAE output (used for resizing the input image and for computing the latent noise height).
width: 768  # Image width of the desired VAE output (used for resizing the input image and for computing the latent noise width).
image: ./experiments/2023-03-27_21-40-35_img2img_single-inference/images/output-0_diffstep-25.png  # Path to a local image file.
mask: ./resources/astronaut_mask.png  # Path to a local mask image.
