# STABLE DIFFUSION EXPERIMENT CONFIGURATION
# This config file contains the experiment configuration for the Stable Diffusion txt2img model from the diffusers library.


# IDENTIFIER CONFIGURATIONS
# Specifies the model and experiment identifiers.
# DO NOT CHANGE THESE!
model_identifier: txt2img
exp_identifier: interpolation


# MODEL CONFIGURATIONS
# Specifies the model configurations.
model_id: ./weights/stable-diffusion-2-1  # Name of the Stable Diffusion repository on HuggingFace (e.g. stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1) or the path to the cloned repository (e.g. /mypath/stable-diffusion-2-1).
scheduler: DPMSolverMultistepScheduler  # Name of the scheduler algorithm.
att_slicing: True  # Whether attention slicing should be used (reduces memory consumption during the diffusion process at the cost of speed).
vae_slicing: True  # Whether VAE slicing should be used (reduces memory consumption during the decoding stage at the cost of speed).
vae_tiling: False  # Whether VAE tiling should be used (reduces memory consumption during the decoding stage at the cost of speed).
enable_xformers: False  # Whether to enable xFormers for optimized performance in the attention blocks (requires the xformers package).
gpu_id: 0  # GPU index.
diffusion_steps: 25  # Amount of diffusion steps to perform (higher values increase quality at the cost of speed).
guidance_scale: 9.5  # Guidance scale factor for classifier free guidance (higher values lead to better correspondence to the prompt, while lower values increase diversity).


# EXPERIMENT CONFIGURATIONS
# Specifies the experiment configurations.
output_path: /data/alen_smajic/FP_KI_Stable_Diffusion/experiments  # Path for storing the experiment results (a new folder will be placed at the specified location).
gif_frame_dur: 100  # Specifies the frame duration in milliseconds for the produced gifs.
interpolation_steps: 30  # Specifies the amount of interpolation steps to perform.
interpolation_method: slerp  # Specifies the interpolation method (can be either "lerp" for linear interpolation or "slerp" for spherical linear interpolation).
inter_prompts:  # List of prompts to interpolate. List items can be simple prompts or paths to local files containing the prompt embeddings.
