# STABLE DIFFUSION EXPERIMENT CONFIGURATION
# This config file contains the experiment configuration for the Stable Diffusion txt2img model from the diffusers library.


# IDENTIFIER CONFIGURATIONS
# Specifies the model and experiment identifiers.
# DO NOT CHANGE THESE!
model_identifier: txt2img
exp_identifier: single-inference


# MODEL CONFIGURATIONS
# Specifies the model configurations.
model_id: /data/alen_smajic/FP_KI_Stable_Diffusion/weights/stable-diffusion-2-1-base  # Name of the Stable Diffusion repository on HuggingFace (e.g. stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1) or the path to the cloned repository (e.g. /mypath/stable-diffusion-2-1).
scheduler: DPMSolverMultistepScheduler  # Name of the scheduler algorithm.
att_slicing: True  # Whether attention slicing should be used (reduces memory consumption during the diffusion process at the cost of speed).
vae_slicing: True  # Whether VAE slicing should be used (reduces memory consumption during the decoding stage at the cost of speed).
enable_xformers: False  # Whether to enable xFormers for optimized performance in the attention blocks (requires the xformers package).
gpu_id: 0  # GPU index.
diffusion_steps: 25  # Amount of diffusion steps to perform (higher values increase quality at the cost of speed).
guidance_scale: 9.5  # Guidance scale factor for classifier free guidance (higher values lead to better correspondence to the prompt, while lower values increase diversity).


# EXPERIMENT CONFIGURATIONS
# Specifies the experiment configurations.
output_path: /data/alen_smajic/FP_KI_Stable_Diffusion/experiments  # Path for storing the experiment results (a new folder will be placed at the specified location).
gif_frame_dur: 200  # Specifies the frame duration in milliseconds for the produced gifs.

num_steps: 10
step_size: 0.01

# PROMPT CONFIGURATION
prompt: A Hyperrealistic photograph of a futuristic city with tall skyscrapers and the sky made out galaxies, lens flares, cinematic, hdri, matte painting, concept art, celestial, soft render, highly detailed, cgsociety, octane render, trending on artstation, HQ, 4k, 8k.|black and white, blurry, painting, drawing, low resolution, watermark  # Input prompt where the positive part is separated from the negative part by a vertical line "|" without any whitespace in between.
load_prompt_embeds: None  # Path to a local file containing the prompt embeddings. Caution the parameter "prompt" does not apply, if a pre-generated prompt embedding is loaded from a file.
# LATENT NOISE CONFIGURATION
rand_seed: 0  # Random seed for sampling reproducible latent noise.
height: 512  # Image height of the desired VAE output (used for computing the latent noise height).
width: 512  # Image width of the desired VAE output (used for computing the latent noise width).
images_per_prompt: 10  # Amount of images to generate per prompt (specifies the batch dimension of the latent noise).
load_latent_noise: None  # Path to a local file containing the latent noise tensor. Caution the parameters "rand_seed", "height", "width" and "images_per_prompt" do not apply, if a pre-generated latent noise tensor is loaded from a file.
