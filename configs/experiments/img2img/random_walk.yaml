# STABLE DIFFUSION EXPERIMENT CONFIGURATION
# This config file contains the experiment configuration for the Stable Diffusion img2img model from the diffusers library.


# IDENTIFIER CONFIGURATIONS
# Specifies the model and experiment identifiers.
# DO NOT CHANGE THESE!
model_identifier: img2img
exp_identifier: random-walk


# MODEL CONFIGURATIONS
# Specifies the model configurations.
model_id: ./weights/stable-diffusion-2-1  # Name of the Stable Diffusion repository on HuggingFace (e.g. stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1) or the path to the cloned repository (e.g. /mypath/stable-diffusion-2-1).
scheduler: DPMSolverMultistepScheduler  # Name of the scheduler algorithm.
att_slicing: True  # Whether attention slicing should be used (reduces memory consumption during the diffusion process at the cost of speed).
vae_slicing: True  # Whether VAE slicing should be used (reduces memory consumption during the decoding stage at the cost of speed).
vae_tiling: False  # Whether VAE tiling should be used (reduces memory consumption during the decoding stage at the cost of speed).
enable_xformers: False  # Whether to enable xFormers for optimized performance in the attention blocks (requires the xformers package).
gpu_id: 0  # GPU index.
diffusion_steps: 25  # Amount of diffusion steps to perform (higher values increase quality at the cost of speed).
guidance_scale: 9.5  # Guidance scale factor for classifier free guidance (higher values lead to better correspondence to the prompt, while lower values increase diversity).


# EXPERIMENT CONFIGURATIONS
# Specifies the experiment configurations.
output_path: ./experiments  # Path for storing the experiment results (a new folder will be placed at the specified location).
gif_frame_dur: 75  # Specifies the frame duration in milliseconds for the produced gifs.
prompt_rand_walk: True  # Whether to perform a random walk within the latent space of the text encoder.
noise_rand_walk: True  # Whether to perform a random walk within the latent space of the VAE.
walk_steps: 50  # Specifies the amount of steps for the random walk.
step_size: 0.0095  # Specifies the step size for each step of the random walk.
walk_directions: 3  # Specifies the amount of latent space directions to be explored by the random walk.
# PROMPT CONFIGURATION
prompt: An astronaut riding a horse on the moon.|black and white, blurry, painting, drawing, low resolution, watermark  # Input prompt where the positive part is separated from the negative part by a vertical line "|" without any whitespace in between.
load_prompt_embeds: ./experiments/2023-03-27_21-40-35_img2img_single-inference/embeddings/output-0_diffstep-25.pt  # Path to a local file containing the prompt embeddings. Caution the parameter "prompt" does not apply, if a pre-generated prompt embedding is loaded from a file.
# LATENT NOISE & IMAGE CONFIGURATION
rand_seed: 0  # Random seed for sampling reproducible latent noise that is added to the input image and for sampling the encoded latents of the input image from the VAE.
height: 768  # Image height of the desired VAE output (used for resizing the input image and for computing the latent noise height).
width: 768  # Image width of the desired VAE output (used for resizing the input image and for computing the latent noise width).
images_per_prompt: 1  # Amount of images to generate per prompt (specifies the batch dimension of the latent noise).
load_latent_noise: ./experiments/2023-03-27_21-40-35_img2img_single-inference/embeddings/output-0_diffstep-25.pt  # Path to a local file containing the latent noise tensor. Caution the parameters "height", "width" and "images_per_prompt" do not apply, if a pre-generated latent noise tensor is loaded from a file.
image: ./experiments/2023-03-27_18-43-02_txt2img_single-inference/images/output-3_diffstep-25.png  # Path to a local image file.
strength: 0.8  # Specifies the degree to which the model should adjust the input image as a number between 0 and 1. The amount of diffusion steps, will be scaled by this number (diffusion_steps remains unchanged if strength set to 1).
