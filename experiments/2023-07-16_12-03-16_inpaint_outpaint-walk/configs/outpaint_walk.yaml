# STABLE DIFFUSION EXPERIMENT CONFIGURATION
# This config file contains the experiment configuration for the Stable Diffusion inpaint model from the diffusers library.


# IDENTIFIER CONFIGURATIONS
# Specifies the model and experiment identifiers.
# DO NOT CHANGE THESE!
model_identifier: inpaint
exp_identifier: outpaint-walk


# MODEL CONFIGURATIONS
# Specifies the model configurations.
model_id: ./weights/stable-diffusion-2-inpainting  # Name of the Stable Diffusion repository on HuggingFace (e.g. stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1) or the path to the cloned repository (e.g. /mypath/stable-diffusion-2-inpainting).
scheduler: DPMSolverMultistepScheduler  # Name of the scheduler algorithm.
att_slicing: True  # Whether attention slicing should be used (reduces memory consumption during the diffusion process at the cost of speed).
vae_slicing: True  # Whether VAE slicing should be used (reduces memory consumption during the decoding stage at the cost of speed).
vae_tiling: False  # Whether VAE tiling should be used (reduces memory consumption during the decoding stage at the cost of speed).
enable_xformers: False  # Whether to enable xFormers for optimized performance in the attention blocks (requires the xformers package).
gpu_id: 0  # GPU index.
diffusion_steps: 25  # Amount of diffusion steps to perform (higher values increase quality at the cost of speed).
guidance_scale: 9.5  # Guidance scale factor for classifier free guidance (higher values lead to better correspondence to the prompt, while lower values increase diversity).


# EXPERIMENT CONFIGURATIONS
# Specifies the experiment configurations.
output_path: ./experiments  # Path for storing the experiment results (a new folder will be placed at the specified location).
gif_frame_dur: 30  # Specifies the frame duration in milliseconds for the produced gif.
translation_factor: 0.4  # Float value between 0 and 1, which specifies the translation factor between two key-frames.
num_filler_frames: 64  # Amount of filler frames, which are being produced between two key-frames.
# PROMPT CONFIGURATION
prompts:  # List of prompts for the outpaint walk. List items can be simple prompts or paths to local files containing the prompt embeddings.

height: 512  # Image height of the desired VAE output (used for resizing the input image and for computing the latent noise height).
width: 648  # Image width of the desired VAE output (used for resizing the input image and for computing the latent noise width).
image: ./resources/the_starry_night.png  # Path to a local image file, which initializes the outpaint walk.
